# JOANA Result Generation

This repository contains the scripts required to generate static analysis results using **JOANA**.

The folders `joana/reports` and `joana/sdg` are used to store the reports and SDG (System Dependence Graph) files generated by JOANA.

## How to Run the Analysis

To generate the results, simply run the notebook:

```
generating_results.ipynb
```

This notebook processes the output data from JOANA and produces consolidated results.

If you want to avoid the full recomputation of JOANA's outputs, a precompiled version of the results is already available in:

* `merge_file.csv`

Additionally, the results compared with the **SA** tool are available in:

* `soot-results.csv`

## Output

All generated results will be saved in the `output/` directory.
